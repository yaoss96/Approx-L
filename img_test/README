Step 1: First, run img_pre.py to convert the image into a hexadecimal text file.

Step 2: Use an RTL simulation tool to read the hexadecimal text and perform simulation using the actual approximate divider code to generate the processed text file.

Step 3: Use img_comp.py to reconvert the text file generated by the RTL simulation. Compare it with the image processing results of an exact divider to calculate the PSNR and SSIM.
